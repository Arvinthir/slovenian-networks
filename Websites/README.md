The graphs in this category represent certain Slovenian websites which have been crawled as part of the project. Vertices represent individual webpages and are connected if it is possible to navigate from one page to another via a hyperlink. The graphs are directed and have been stored in the Pajek NET data format.

These networks are:
- **gov_si** - A network of the central website of the state administration of Slovenia.
- **ljubljana_si** - A network of the website of the city of Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia.
- **slovenia_si** - A network of the self-advertised "main national access point" website of Slovenia.

Basic statistics for the networks are gathered in the following table:
| Website                     | Vertices | Edges      |
|-----------------------------|----------|------------|
| www.gov.si                  | 3,856     | 87,377     |
| www.ljubljana.si            | 45,346   | 372,446    |
| www.slovenia.si             | 5,152     | 112,830    |
