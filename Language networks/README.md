The graphs in this category represent words in the Slovenian language, which are connected if their Levenshtein distance is less or equal to the number selected for the criteria. The graphs are undirected and have been stored in the Pajek NET data format.

Basic statistics for the networks are gathered in the following table:
| Network                | Vertices | Edges      |
|------------------------|----------|------------|
| Levenshtein distance 1 | 355.579  | 309.506    |
| Levenshtein distance 2 | 355.579  | 4.235.689  |
| Levenshtein distance 3 | 355.579  | 38.939.119 |

Due to its size, the largest network had to be split into two archives to accomodate GitHub's storage limit.
