The graphs in this category represent networks of places, connected if they are less than a certain air distance apart. The name of the file contains the criteria for connectivity, with the exception of the bicycle network. The graphs are undirected and have been stored in the Pajek NET data format.

The networks are as follows:
- **bicycle_rentals** - A network of bicycle rental places in Ljubljana, connected if they are less than 1km apart.
- **doctors_offices** - Two networks of doctor's offices in Slovenia.
- **fire_stations** - Two networks of fire stations in Slovenia.
- **hospitals** - Three networks of hospitals in Slovenia.
- **places_of_worship** - Two networks of places of worship (such as churches) in Slovenia.
- **police_stations** - Two networks of police stations in Slovenia.
- **post_offices** - Two networks of post offices in Slovenia.

Basic statistics for the networks are gathered in the following table:
