# A collection of Slovenian networks
This repository contains graphs that represent Slovenian networks. It was created as part of my undergraduate thesis project. The collection contains 96 different networks with a combined total of 1,407,955 nodes and 335,999,930 edges.

Networks are divided into five groups:
- [**Geographical networks**](<./Geographical networks>), which contain networks of places (e.g. police stations), connected if they are less than a certain air distance apart.
- [**Language networks**](<./Language networks>), which are networks created with the words of the Slovenian language.
- [**Street networks**](<./Street networks>), which represent street networks of Slovenian cities.
- [**Websites**](<./Websites>), which contain network maps of certain Slovenian websites.
- [**Other networks**](<./Other networks>), which contain other created networks that didn't fit in any of the above categories.
